\section{Population sizes}

Figure \ref{fig:r_squared_pop} show the same data as was shown in Figure \ref{fig:r_squared} with the population sizes plotted as well. For long polymers the population fluctuates significantly and this is most likely influences the found values for $\langle r^2 \rangle$.
