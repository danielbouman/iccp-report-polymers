\subsection{Some notes on the program}
The energy calculations, LJ potential and bending energy, are for better performance written in Fortran. To make a connection between the Fortran code and the Python program, an interface is made using \emph{Fortran to Python interface generator} (F2PY). F2PY creates a Python C/API extension module that makes it possible to call the in Fortran written energy subroutine.

For low temperatures it is expected that the attractive part of the LJ-potential will dominate, causing the polymer to coil up. For higher temperatures, the repulsive part will always dominate, causing the polymer to expand. Since the LJ-potential is negligible beyond a distance of 2.5$\sigma$, the end to end distance will become independent on the temperature for high temperatures. Since a random walk will exhibit an end to end distance $r$ somewhere between these two regimes, it is expected that inbetween the two regimes the temperature $T_c$ can be found where $\langle r^2 \rangle$ equals $\langle r_{random}^2 \rangle$, where $\langle r_{random}^2 \rangle = N$ is the expectation value of the end to end distance squared for a random walk in 2 dimensions.

From the fit a value of $T_c \approx 0.35$ is found.
