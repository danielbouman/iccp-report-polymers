\emph{A molecular dynamics simulation was performed for a system of argon particles in a box with periodic boundary conditions. The interaction is modelled with a Lennard-Jones potential. Several physical quantities were extracted from the simulation for several values of the density and temperature, as to analyze the behaviour of argon in different phases. Good results for the temperature, potential energy and correlation function were found. Results for the pressure, specific heat and diffusion constant, however, were less accurate and did not correspond quite as well with values previously found.}
