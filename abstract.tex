Polymers are chemical compounds, whose constituents are multiple repeating units. Monopolymers are polymers that consist of a single repeated unit. To study the behaviour of monopolymers of different lengths at various temperatures, a simulation is written in Python and Fortran. The model for the polymers is based on approximating the interaction between the monomers with a Lennard-Jones potential and a bending energy between adjacent monomers. Simulations were made using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method to investigate the scaling behaviour of the end-to-end distance, radius of gyration, and the temperature dependency of the polymers. The influence of the bending energy on the radius of gyration is also discussed.
