\section{Conclusion}
Most of the simulation results are in good agreement with expectations. The temperature dependency of the end-to-end distance becomes significantly less as the temperature increases, as was expected. The Flory constant was found very close to the value found in literature. The scaling behaviour of the end-to-end distance however, shows some fluctuation for longer polymer lengths. This is most likely due to unpredictable population size of the ensembles using PERM. These fluctuations were present in almost all the simulations. Attempts to correct the unpredictability by tuning the coefficients for the upper and lower weight limits, have mostly failed.
