\section{Conclusion}


The population size of the ensembles using PERM were oftenly unpredictable. This most likely caused some, if not all of the (sometimes large) fluctuations in the end-to-end distances and radii of gyration. Attempts to correct the unpredictability by tuning the coefficients for the upper and lower weight limits, have mostly failed.
