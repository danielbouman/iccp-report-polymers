\section{Introduction}
A simulation is written in Python and Fortran. 

The interaction between the beads is modelled by a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential (Eq. \ref{eq:lj} and a bending energy (Eq. \ref{eq:bending_energy}) to simulate semi-flexible polymers.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lj}
    V_{LJ} = 4\epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6} \right],
\end{equation} where $\epsilon$ is the depth of the potential well, $\sigma$ is the finite distance where the potential is zero and $r$ is the distance between two particles. The parameters chosen for the LJ potential are $\epsilon=0.25$ and $\sigma=0.8$ \cite{jmt}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bending_energy}
    \epsilon_b(1-\cos{\theta}),
\end{equation} where $\epsilon_b$ is the bending energy and $\theta$ is the angle between the new and preceding bead \cite{hsu2011review}.

\subsection{Markov chain}
For a canonical ensemble the probability of a given state $X$ is proportional to the Boltzmann weight, $P(\alpha) \propto e^{-\beta E(\alpha)}$. Here $\beta=1/\left(k_B T\right)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ the temperature and $E(X)$ the energy of a state $\alpha$. However, for states which have high $E$ the probabilities $P$ become vanishingly small. For computational reasons then, a bias for lower energies should be implemented when generating configurations.\todo[inline]{This is too ambiguous}

For polymers, it is natural to generate configurations on a per monomer basis. The energy gained by adding a monomer is dependent only on previously placed monomers. This means we can model the system as a Markov chain.

\subsection{Roulette-wheel algorithm}
The roulette-wheel algorithm, also known as fitness proportionate selection, is a method to select a member $j$ from a population with $N$ members, with a certain probability $p_j$. This is done by dividing the interval $[0,1]$ into $N$ segments of size $p_j$. Then a uniform random number is generated in that same interval. A member is selected by checking in which interval the random number lies.


\subsection{Rosenbluth and Rosenbluth algorithm}
In $d$ dimensions, if the distance between each monomer is set to 1, the amount of possible new monomer positions $N_{\theta}$ are positioned on a ($d$-1)-sphere of unit radius, with the last monomer as the centre.
