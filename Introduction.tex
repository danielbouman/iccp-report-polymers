\section{Introduction}
The behaviour of argon in a box with periodic boundary conditions is simulated using the molecular dynamics method (MD). Python is used as programming language. For the interaction between the argon particles a Lennard-Jones potential

\begin{gather*}
U(r) = 4\epsilon \left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]
\end{gather*}
is used, which corresponds well with experimental results for large ranges of parameters for argon\cite{hoover1970comparison}. For convenience all physical quantities are expressed in reduced units, such that $m=1$, $\epsilon = 1$ and $\sigma = 1$.
